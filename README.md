# Artigo_2_Nome_Provisorio

This repository contains some files related to the work presented in **nome do artigo (link)**.

- **2V-Lnd-Facets-Prob**: contains the facet inequalities of the $\mathcal{L}_{ND}$ polytope for the scenario considered in theorem 1.

- **2V-Lnd-Facets-Corr**: contains facet inequalities of the $\mathcal{L}_{ND}$ polytope for the scenario considered in theorem 1. This file contains one inequality for each equivalence class of facets for this polytope (considering the scenario's symmetries).

- **2V-L-Facets-Prob**: contains the facet inequalities of the $\mathcal{L}_{G}$ polytope for the scenario considered in theorem 1.
