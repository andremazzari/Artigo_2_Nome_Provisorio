This repository contains some files related to the work presented in **nome do artigo (link)**. The facet inequalities for the polytopes considered were found using the software [PANDA](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2192440621000484).

- **2V-Lnd-Facets-Prob**: contains the facet inequalities of the $\mathcal{L}_{ND}$ polytope for the scenario considered in theorem 1 and appendix A.

- **2V-Lnd-Facets-Corr**: contains facet inequalities of the $\mathcal{L}_{ND}$ polytope for the scenario considered in theorem 1 and appendix A. This file contains one inequality for each equivalence class of facets for this polytope (considering the scenario's symmetries).
